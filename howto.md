This short document will guide you through the steps to use my template. Note that this is a work in development and feedback is welcome.


## First use

Follow the steps:
1. $ conda env create -f environment.yml
2. $ pre-commit install

### Getting the website
On the directory you want to copy, type:

``` sh
$ git clone https://github.com/vcaldas/vcaldas.github.io.git
```

This command will create a folder "vcaldas.github.io".

Navigate inside the folder and get the gulp packages that will be used:

``` sh
$ npm install
```

#### Gulp

The following Gulp pipelines are available:


``` sh
$ gulp
```

Compile and launch the website

``` sh
$ gulp clean
```
Remove clean all generated files, including the website. It runs before also when building to deploy.


``` sh
$ gulp
```
