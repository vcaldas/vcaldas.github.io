This is the source code for my personal blog.

Made with Flask + pure HTML/CSS with Jinja2 templating. The entire architecture is hosted with Github (formerly Heroku).

If you're interested in using this template, check out this [tutorial](http://john-b-yang.github.io/flask-website/) I wrote to help you get set up. Edit the "pages" folder to write your own new blog posts using Markdown files. For more styling related edits, look into the "static" folder for CSS, Javascript, and extra assets such as pictures.
